About a year ago, I read a coffee table book about Before I Die Walls. I recommend clicking on the previous link to learn more, but in short, a Before I Die Wall is huge chalkboard with spaces for people to finish the sentence "Before I Die I Want to...". A public bucket list and art project in one. The idea is to encourage communities across the globe to contemplate mortality and share both common and personal fears, ambitions, hopes, and dreams. I fell in love with the idea and the responses I read from existing walls, and was inspired to create my own for our local community. After winning a monthly pitch contest from the house I live at to follow through with the project, I gave it a shot
